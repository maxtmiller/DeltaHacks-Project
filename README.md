## Our Project:

Meet SpotSense, a user-friendly web app that takes the guesswork out of checking for skin cancer. Simply upload or snap a photo through your webcam, and our TensorFlow model will analyze it to see if it might be malignant or benign. Your images are stored securely in an SQL database, and there’s even a “Help” section, powered by Google Map that help find nearby hospitals. Need more guidance? Our Cohere-powered chatbot is on hand to answer questions about skin diseases, and Google OAuth keeps everything secure for a smooth experience.
